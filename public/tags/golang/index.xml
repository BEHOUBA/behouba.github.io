      <description>Introduction In the field of computer science, forensic analysis, also known as computer forensics, is a specialized domain that focuses on the extraction of evidence from electronic devices and digital data. Forensic analysis goals are to identify, preserve, recover, analyze, and ultimately present factual information and expert opinions about cybercrimes or other digital activities. The computer forensic analyst uses various techniques and tools to guide his investigations. Tools such as Wireshark, Volatility, Autopsy, and others are popular forensic analysis tools across various operating systems.</description>

      <description>This year, during an industrial project that is part of my master&amp;rsquo;s program, I had the opportunity to make my first steps into the world of kernel fuzzing. This was a great learning experience, during which I had the opportunity to work with wonderful people. In this blog post, I will describe my journey into the world of kernel fuzzing.&#xA;I have to admit that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about fuzzing when I was finishing my first semester of the Master of Software Engineering at Innopolis University.</description>
