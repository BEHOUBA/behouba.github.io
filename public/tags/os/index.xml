      <description>This year, during an industrial project that is part of my master&amp;rsquo;s program, I had the opportunity to make my first steps into the world of kernel fuzzing. This was a great learning experience, during which I had the opportunity to work with wonderful people. In this blog post, I will describe my journey into the world of kernel fuzzing.&#xA;I have to admit that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about fuzzing when I was finishing my first semester of the Master of Software Engineering at Innopolis University.</description>

Let’s take a journey together, from the moment you hit that power button to when you’re greeted by the login screen. I’ll explain this process for Fedora which is my favorite Linux distribution!</description>
