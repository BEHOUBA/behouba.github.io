&lt;p>In the field of computer science, forensic analysis, also known as computer forensics, is a specialized domain that focuses on the extraction of evidence from electronic devices and digital data. Forensic analysis goals are to identify, preserve, recover, analyze, and ultimately present factual information and expert opinions about cybercrimes or other digital activities. The computer forensic analyst uses various techniques and tools to guide his investigations. Tools such as Wireshark, Volatility, Autopsy, and others are popular forensic analysis tools across various operating systems. In recent years, containerized applications have become popular. Containers are not immune to cyberattacks, and when there are suspicious malicious activities, it may be useful to be able to investigate our container without disturbing the operation of that container. This is when &lt;code>checkpoinctl&lt;/code> came in handy. &lt;code>checkpointcl&lt;/code> is CLI project from the open-source organization CRIU (Checkpoint Restore In Userspace) that makes it easy to inspect container checkpoints created by CRIU. In this article, we will see how &lt;code>checkpointcl&lt;/code> can be used as a forensic analysis tool for container checkpoints.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Discovering Kernel Fuzzing</title><link>https://behouba.github.io/behouba.github.io/2022/08/discovering-kernel-fuzzing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2022 18:45:52 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://behouba.github.io/behouba.github.io/2022/08/discovering-kernel-fuzzing/</guid><description>&lt;p>This year, during an industrial project that is part of my master&amp;rsquo;s program, I had the opportunity to make my first steps into the world of kernel fuzzing. This was a great learning experience, during which I had the opportunity to work with wonderful people. In this blog post, I will describe my journey into the world of kernel fuzzing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have to admit that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about fuzzing when I was finishing my first semester of the Master of Software Engineering at &lt;a href="https://innopolis.university/en/">Innopolis University&lt;/a>. Before the end of the first semester, we have to choose an industrial project for the next semester. To do so, we attended multiple project presentation sessions with representatives of different companies. During the project presentations, we were presented with many interesting projects covering various areas of software engineering. One project from KasperskyLab was the most appealing to me; I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly why, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about the project before the presentation. But I think it was because I wanted to learn something outside of my comfort zone. The project was presented by Anna Melekhova, a senior engineer at KasperskyLab. The project was about researching kernel fuzzing approaches and their implementation for Kaspersky OS, a new operating system in development at KasperskyLab. I chose this project and got it accepted along with four other classmates.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
