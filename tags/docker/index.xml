&lt;p>In the field of computer science, forensic analysis, also known as computer forensics, is a specialized domain that focuses on the extraction of evidence from electronic devices and digital data. Forensic analysis goals are to identify, preserve, recover, analyze, and ultimately present factual information and expert opinions about cybercrimes or other digital activities. The computer forensic analyst uses various techniques and tools to guide his investigations. Tools such as Wireshark, Volatility, Autopsy, and others are popular forensic analysis tools across various operating systems. In recent years, containerized applications have become popular. Containers are not immune to cyberattacks, and when there are suspicious malicious activities, it may be useful to be able to investigate our container without disturbing the operation of that container. This is when &lt;code>checkpoinctl&lt;/code> came in handy. &lt;code>checkpointcl&lt;/code> is CLI project from the open-source organization CRIU (Checkpoint Restore In Userspace) that makes it easy to inspect container checkpoints created by CRIU. In this article, we will see how &lt;code>checkpointcl&lt;/code> can be used as a forensic analysis tool for container checkpoints.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
